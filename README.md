Apertus

Apertus immutably stores and interprets data as cryptocurrency on blockchains

Apertus is an open source client that enables basic data read-write, communication and search functionality on crypto coin wallets that support bitcoin's standard set of RPC commands. (ex BTC, LTC...)  It also includes social networking features such as User or Group profiles,  #Hash tagging, Following and sharing.  When connected to a wallet ADD monitors and creates a coin agnostic, web browseable index of any data stored by other ADD clients in near realtime. Saved Data can be a combination of plain UTF8 Text and 1 or many binary files such as images, documents or even complete websites with no file size or file count limits. Data saved on a blockchain in this manner can later be retrieved from the blockchain and viewed in a browser by entering a single transaction ID in the ADD client.

NOTE: Coins used in the saving process are not recoverable.
